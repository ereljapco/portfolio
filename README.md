Finally! A portfolio ðŸŽ‰

Thanks to [BPI Foundation](https://www.bpifoundation.org/) and [Bayan Academy](https://www.bayanacademy.org/), I was able to build this portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Desktop-first workflow
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- Plan before you code
  - I wish I knew this sooner. Being able to create a sitemap, wireframe, and prototype made it easier to code the website.
- Mobile-first workflow is easier
  - The prototype that we created was for desktop view. And, boy, it made it harder for me to add the responsiveness for smaller devices. But maybe because I was used to a mobile-first workflow.

### Continued Development

- Use the Github API to display the featured projects/repo.
- Add a projects page to display all the projects
